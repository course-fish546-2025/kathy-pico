# Transfer files from armbrust lab server
Previously, I set up an SSH key pair in order to log in to my server from this server. 
These files have already been trimmed and Qc'd. 

```{bash}
## grab a subset of files from grazer (1 for now)
# only want diel experiments and paired data

# grab only a subset of files and save in txt file
ssh klqi@grazer "ls /mnt/nfs/projects/armbrust-metat/gradients3/g3_station_ns_metat/qc_data/G3.DIEL*.fastq.gz | grep -v '.unpaired.fastq.gz'" | head -n 6 > file_list.txt

# recursively grab files from grazer
while read file; do
    rsync -av klqi@grazer:"$file" /home/shared/16TB_HDD_01/fish546/kathy-pico/data/trimmed/
done < file_list.txt
```
