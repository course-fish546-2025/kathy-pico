1. **What is `tmux` and how does this relate to our current way of working on raven?**

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer and is a tool to create "pseudo-termianls" from a program. When working over a remote connection, such as SSH, `tmux` allows for a session to be maintained even if the user is disconnected. This is helpful for Raven, so that we can run multiple processes at a time. 

2. **What is ssh and what would the code be you would type if you were going to ssh into raven?**
SSH (secure shell) is an encrypted way to connect to other servers. 

```ssh klqi@raven.fish.washington.edu```

3. **What has been the most challenging part of your research project? Are you happy with your organization skills? If not what could be improved?**

The most challenging part of my project is knowing what to do next. I think my programming/computer skills are sufficient, but sometimes I struggle with understanding which software tools to use and how to interpret their outputs. 

4. **For last weeks assignment what did you appreciate the most about knitting documents?**

I liked how it created a clean HTML file that you could easily share code and outputs with others.
