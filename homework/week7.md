1. **What is your current grade in the class? How many issues are open in our research repository?**

I currently have 1 issue on my repo- I think I forgot to update my week4 assignment with my alignment visualizations, so I'll fix that asap. My grade looks good, other than that issue from the assignment. I ran out of time to knit my presentation from last week's assignment, so I'll fix that very soon too. 

2. **Re-reading this weekâ€™s reading, what are 2 things that resonate with you now that made little practical sense in week 2. What is one aspect that you still wonder about or is unclear?**
I understand the mapping/alignment at a much deeper level now after doing it myself with bowtie2 and Salmon. I also know how to better use visualization tools, such as IGV, to show the results. I am choosing to stick to Python instead of R to plot my results though. 

I still feel a bit unclear on the experimental side of things, since I haven't done that part on my own though. For example, I don't fully understand how poly-a selection vs non-selected sequencing works, and how eukaryotes/bacteria are represented from both. s

3. **What is epigenetics and how could it relate to your own research project?**
Epigenetics is the study of how gene expression can change without alterations to the underlying nucleotides themselves. These changes are typically controlled by the environment and can be heritable. A few examples include DNA methylation and histone modifications. 

This could relate to my own research project if I decided to include another study area in a warmer environment. That way, I would be able to check if there are matching bacterial strains, and see if there is a difference in expression.

4. **Describe what a GFF file is?**
GFF stands for Genome Feature Format. It is a file that contains information about genomic features, such as annotations pertaining to genes or transcripts. It can also contain infomation on methylated regions, like start and end coordinates for where methylation occurs.

5. **What are two ways describing CG motifs could have value?**
CG motifs are parts of DNA where there is a -CG- sequence. These motifs are good for detecting epigenetics by: 

  1) Identifying where DNA methylation occurs
  2) Ues as biomarkers for (disease, diagnosis, prognosis)
