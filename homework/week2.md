## Week 02 Question Set

a)  **What do you feel was the most impressive thing you did in class last week was?**
Last week, it was cool downloading the annotation table and joining it with the blast results to see the matched organisms.

b)  **What is your weekly goal for making progress on your project? What is the next step?**
I talked to my lab members about my project idea, and I got ideas on how to map our transcripts to a reference genome. My next step is to figure out what my genes of interest are for photoinhibition for cyanobacteria, then to find them in the annotation list. 

c)  **There were two readings this week not from the textbook, meant for two different audiences. Which reading did you get the most out of and why? Do you have any questions regarding the Journal of Shellfish Research paper?**
Personally, I liked the _Opportunities in Functional Genomics_ paper more because it mentions the importance of each step of a project. I liked how a table was provided with a list of tools associated with each step of analysis. The textbook chapter was more technical when working with the software, which will be helpful for our assignments/projects.

d)  **What is your favorite thing about markdown and why?**
I like how flexibility and its clean appearance when run.

e) **What is the differnce between `curl` and `wget`? When would you used one over the other?**
`wget` and `curl` are both command line tools for downloading or transferring files between servers. `wget` can be used to download HTTP/FTP files, and it can do so recursively, which is nice for quickly downloading files in a simple way. `curl` has more protocols it can transfer files with, such as SFTP and SCP, and supports parallel downloading which puts less strain on computational resources. Furthermore, it is powered by an API and not just command line only, like `wget. 

I would use `curl` when downloading complex files with protocols not supported by `wget`, and vice versa when I need to quickly download a file (or many of the same file types) from a source.
